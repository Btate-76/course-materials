# How to Submit Weekly Assignments

Your work should always be posted in your private repository. In fact, you may keep notes, drafts, presentations --  or whatever you like here. But for each assignment, you will need to create a folder that includes both your document and any included images or resources.

GitHub allows for private, group, and public repositories. But it does not provide for private branches or folders within a repository. Because I would like each of you to see each other's work -- but not until all are finished -- I will move completed assignments into a group repository before the next week.

#### Step 1: Store your assignment in a folder

Please use your **initials** (e.g., xyz) and a folder name such as:

```
xyz-weekly-1
xyz-critical-review
```
All images should be in this folder and referenced using relative links. We practiced this in the GitHub assignment, so this should not be difficult.

#### Step 2: Notify me that your assignment is complete

- Create a new issue in your private repository.
- Name the issue "Completed assignment (whatever it is)".
- In the issue description, tag me by including @lisah2u and paste in the revision SHA.
- Submit your issue.
- Your submission SHA should have a date and time no later than 5:30 of the class date that it is due.
