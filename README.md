# Course Materials and Discussion

This is the main repository for course materials except for slides. I welcome your feedback on course materials in this public site. If you have general questions and want to open discussion with the class, please use issues in the discussion repository (limited to our class only). Hopefully, you'll get plenty of GitHub practice during the first week. If there are any problems, we'll talk about them during class.
