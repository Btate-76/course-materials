# Course Materials

This is the main repository for course materials (with the exception of [slides](https://github.com/ub-idia640-2016/slides)). I welcome your feedback on course materials in this public site. Feel free to use issues or make pull requests once you are comfortable with GitHub.

If you have general questions and want to open discussion with the class, please use issues in the [discussion repository](https://github.com/ub-idia640-2016/discussion) (limited to our class only). Hopefully, you'll get plenty of GitHub practice during the first week. If there are any problems, we'll talk about them during class.
