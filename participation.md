# Participation

There are many ways to participate. I hope that you will engage with other students in discussion and share things you've found or learned. Since 10% of your grade is participation, you will be graded in the following manner: for each of the 10 weekly assignments, I will assign you to review the work of two other students (.5 points each). You will open an issue for each report that you are assigned. Did the writer focus on other concepts or learning points than you? Offer feedback and share your thoughts.
