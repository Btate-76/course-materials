# Critical Review Presentation & Discussion

Lead the class in a discussion of your assigned scientific paper.

5 points total.

Plan on about 10 minutes to include questions. You will probably want a couple of images or charts to help your audience understand the results. Use clear language, even if the authors did not.

- 1 point - Summarize the study (without exhaustive detail). Try to tailor this to your audience. To be a compelling presentation, you want to tell a story. Here are elements you will want to address:
  - Why was this experimented conducted (rationale)?
  - How was it done (methods)?
  - What was learned (results)?
  - What does it mean (interpretation)?
- 1 point - Include a visual aid(s). It's hard to talk about experiments without some sort of visual.
- 1 point - Mention how this fits to the week's topical reading. This is the opportunity to talk about this paper from a "big picture" perspective.
- 1 point - Share thoughts from your critical review. This is your chance to critique or make observations about what you may have learned.
- 1 point - Answer questions to the best of your ability (but be honest if you don't know the answer. Perhaps, someone else will.)
