# Rubric for weekly assignments

**Assignments are always due before class.** Anything with a submission SHA after 5:30 on Wednesday of that week is late.

Each week will include one or more readings of a topical nature. Students are expected to compose a short, weekly review on that topic. The first part summarizes key learning points, while the second provides demonstrative, positive or negative examplars (with screen shots and explanation), drawn from actual media, websites, or applications.

- There are 10 weekly reports.
- Each report is worth 5 points.
- You can miss 1 and still get full credit.

Each weekly report is assesed as follows:

1. Did you include both sections (key learning points and your examples)? (1 point)

2. Did you include *at least* one key point from each chapter / article of the assigned reading for that week? (1 point)

3. Did you include a reference to the original work(s) to include page number? (1 point)

4. Did you provide *at least* one example (your own) from actual practice that illustrates one or more of your key learning points? (1 point)

5. Did your example(s) clearly illustrate key point(s) intended.

How you might lose points:

- For each day an assignment is late, you will lose 1 point. No exceptions.
- You can lose a point with excessive typographical errors.
- You can lose a point if your images / links don't work properly. (You will need to follow the [guidelines for submission](how-to-submit-assignments.md) so that image resources are contained in the same folder as your document.)

These assignments are intended for your benefit: to help cement learning points in your memory and to tie them to practical examples that you will recall later.

You should be able to achieve full points on every assignment if you do the reading early and take short notes, as you go. Then think on what you've learned and consider how these points apply in practice. I'm not looking for detailed knowledge, but evidence that you understand the material.
