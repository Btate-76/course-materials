# GitHub Basics

This assignment is to help prepare you to work in GitHub classroom. We will do some parts in class, and some parts at home. I hope you will experiment and collaborate with one another so that you become comfortable interacting on GitHub within the browser.

Objective: This assignment is not graded, and is intended to give you practice in using GitHub. Minimally, you should feel comfortable:
- Creating directories and documents in your private repository
- Writing and editing markdown documents
- Uploading and linking image files
- Submitting an assignment via creation of an issue and pasting in a revison SHA

If any of this is confusing, we'll practice more in the second class and I'll update these instructions to help make things more clear.

## Part 1 (in class):

1. Create an account on GitHub
2. Email lisah2u@gmail.com
3. While you wait for an email invitation to the class site, check out the [guides](https://guides.github.com). Useful guides to explore include:
	- "[Understanding GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)"
	- "[Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)"
	- "[Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)"

## Part 2 (in class):

Now that you have been invited into the ub-idia640-2016 GitHub classroom, you will see a number of repositories. Each of you will have his/her own **private repository**. I share access with you, but no one else will be able to see inside your repository.

1. Click on README.md in your private repository and **edit**. You could type "Hello World", for instance.
2. To save, you need to scroll down and click on the button, "**Commit Changes**". To commit, is to save. For now, you don't need to type or click on  anything else.
2. Do you see your changes? Notice that there is a 7-digit alphanumeric number with a reference to "time ago" next to it. For example, it may say "2 minutes ago". That is called a revision SHA and is a unique number that identifies your commit.
3. Click on that number. It will expand out to a really long number (the actual SHA). **Copy the SHA** so you can paste it in an issue.
4. Now look for "issues" and click on it. (Issues are like a discussion board, but you can tag and open/close issues.)
5. **Create a new issue** and name it something like, "Completed part 2".
6. In the issue description, **tag me by including @lisah2u and paste in the revision SHA**.
7. **Submit your issue**.
8 Congratulations! You just submitted an issue! And you've learned about "commit", "issue" and "SHA". You also learned how to inform other users about your issue by typing in their @alias.

## Part 3 (at home):

1. Create a markdown document called */xyz-toast/toast.md* where xyz are your initials. The '**/xyz-toast/**' string is a folder, and toast.md is a document inside that folder.
2. Your task is to describe how to make toast. Please include at least one image and at least one hyperlink.
3. When you are finished, follow steps 4 - 6 from Part 2 above to submit an issue to me.

When I get your submission, I will move it into the github-assignment (group) repository where everyone in the class will be able to see and comment on each other's work.

If you feel ambitious, here are some other things you can try:

5. Start an issue or comment on an issue.
6. Try using an external tool such as [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) or [GitBox](http://www.gitboxapp.com) to clone repositories to your computer.
7. Try using GitHub's [Atom](https://atom.io) editor to write markdown.
8. More advanced: What is a pull request? How is this useful? Can you figure out how to do one? If so, please share with the class.
