# Design Problem

Outcome: create a document (**design-problem.md**) in your repository. Follow the guideline below.

For your final project, you will focus on a persuasive design. The design problem does not need to be large. Your problem may be as small as encouraging a user to give feedback during a particular interaction. Or as broad as influencing a user population to stop smoking. Ultimately, your goal will be to affect behavior during some interaction. While persuasion may involve changing attitude or behavior, it will be easier to instrument and measure the effectiveness of your design, if you focus on a specific, desired behavior.

For this assignment, think about an action or process that you would either like to:
- create in the form of a novel design; or,
- improve in some existing site or application, either your own or otherwise. 

Write a short problem statement centered on the interaction you wish to create or improve. Describe your goal, targeted user population, and generally what behavior(s) you want to nudge users toward. If you wish to improve an existing interaction, include a screenshot(s) or link to a video demonstration. 

Don't think too hard about how you would improve this interaction just yet. We're going to work on your problem at intervals throughout this course. You will also learn a lot more about persuasion later in the course. For now, consider the problem on which you will focus. Also, consider the ethics of your design. To learn more about traps you will want to avoid, watch the video at [darkpatterns.org](http://darkpatterns.org).
